# Wes Anderson Movie Sentiment Analysis (+ Web Scraping)

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze the sentiment of IMDb user reviews for Wes Anderson's seven highest-grossing films. The analysis involves web scraping review data from IMDb and performing sentiment analysis to categorize the reviews as positive, neutral, or negative. An interactive dashboard was created in Tableau to visualize the results and provide insights.

## Data Collection
The IMDb user reviews for the top 7 highest-grossing Wes Anderson movies were scraped using Python libraries like Selenium and BeautifulSoup. The scraped data includes:

- Review Title
- Review Text
- Review Rating

## Sentiment Analysis
The sentiment analysis was performed on the review text to categorize them into three categories:

- Positive
- Neutral
- Negative

This analysis was implemented using RoBERTa pre-trained model, which is designed for sentiment classification of text data.

## Data Visualization
An interactive Tableau dashboard was built to display key insights from the sentiment analysis. The following visualizations were included:

- Distribution of Reviewers' Sentiment: Shows the proportion of positive, neutral, and negative reviews for each movie.
- Reviewers' Emotion Distribution for the Movies: Visualizes the emotional tone of reviews for each movie, such as joy, anger, sadness, etc.
- Percentage of Movie Ratings: Displays the percentage breakdown of IMDb ratings for each movie.
- Gross Ranking vs Sentiment Score: Compares each movieâ€™s gross ranking with the average sentiment score of its reviews.
- Most Used Words in Reviews: Highlights the most frequently used words by reviewers, offering insights into common themes or opinions about the movies.

## Results
The sentiment analysis and visualizations revealed several interesting insights:

- Wes Anderson's films generally receive more positive and neutral reviews, with the exception of The Royal Tenenbaums and Asteroid City. Despite The Royal Tenenbaums being the second-highest grossing movie, it has a notably higher share of negative sentiment.
- Joy is the predominant emotion across Wes Anderson's movies, though The Royal Tenenbaums, Asteroid City, and The French Dispatch also show a hint of sadness.
- Most movie ratings fall within the 8 to 10-star range, but a surprising number of 1-star ratings appear, largely driven by reviews of Asteroid City and The Royal Tenenbaums.
- Analysis of gross rankings vs sentiment scores reveals that, despite their commercial success, The Royal Tenenbaums and Asteroid City have the lowest sentiment scores among the top-grossing films.
- Reviewer word frequency highlights terms like "bad," "boring," and "waste" frequently appearing in reviews of The Royal Tenenbaums and Asteroid City, reflecting their more critical reception.

## Further Analysis
Despite the strong box office performance, The Royal Tenenbaums and Asteroid City have higher negative sentiment. We could investigate the specific aspects that contributing to these negative reviews for deeper understanding.
